Parent:

I'm not trying to force you to do things that you don't want to do.

I'm just worried about you.

I care about you and I want you to be happy.

My job...

I'm doing everything I can to keep my job,

but it's hard.

You always say that you feel like I'm pushing you, but I really don't know what else I can do.

I want you to be able to sustain yourself if I lose my job.


Kid:

It's just hard.

Life is just hard for me.

I want to stand up again, pull myself together like before, like you.

But right now I really can't find a way out of this mess.

I know that you care about me, I don't want to let you down.

Everyone is telling me to follow my heart, but how can I follow my heart if I don't even know where my heart is?
